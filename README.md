## Overview

This repository includes four main projects:

1. **Image Compression**  
   Leverages FFT and SVD techniques in Python to compress images while retaining quality.

2. **Financial Services ML Project**  
   Uses big data approaches to develop models for fraud detection or credit risk prediction.

3. **Manufacturing ML Project**  
   Focuses on building predictive maintenance models to forecast equipment failure.

4. **Transportation & Logistics ML Project**  
   Develops demand forecasting models to optimize shipment and delivery planning.

Each project is accompanied by detailed documentation, source code, and instructions on how to run and extend the project.

## Projects

### 1. Image Compression

**Project Idea:**  
Reduce image file sizes without significant quality loss using advanced compression techniques.

**Techniques and Libraries:**

- **FFT-based Compression:**
  - **Libraries Used:**
    - `from matplotlib.image import imread`
    - `import numpy as np`
    - `import matplotlib.pyplot as plt`
    - `from PIL import Image`

- **SVD-based Compression:**
  - **Libraries Used:**
    - `import numpy as np`
    - `import matplotlib.pyplot as plt`
    - `from numpy.linalg import svd`
    - `from PIL import Image`

**Description:**  
- **FFT-based Compression:**  
  Converts images into the frequency domain using the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) and compresses them by retaining significant frequency components.
- **SVD-based Compression:**  
  Applies Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) to decompose the image matrix, allowing reconstruction with fewer singular values for compression.

### 2. Financial Services ML Project

**Project Idea:**  
Develop a fraud detection or credit risk model using a big data approach.

**Objective:**  
Utilize (or simulate) transaction data to classify whether a transaction is fraudulent or predict a credit score/loan default.

**Steps:**
- **Data Acquisition:**  
  Use publicly available datasets (e.g., Kaggleâ€™s "Credit Card Fraud Detection") or simulate realistic financial transaction data.
- **Preprocessing & Feature Engineering:**  
  Clean the data, handle class imbalance if necessary, and engineer features such as transaction amount, time, and location.
- **Modeling:**  
  Train a classifier (e.g., Random Forest, XGBoost, or a neural network) for fraud detection or a regression model for credit scoring.
- **Evaluation:**  
  Use appropriate metrics such as ROC-AUC, precision/recall for classification or RMSE for regression.
- **Deployment:**  
  Package the model in a REST API using Flask or FastAPI and deploy on a cloud service (Heroku, AWS, or Azure).
- **MLOps Touch:**  
  Integrate logging for predictions and set up basic monitoring with a dashboard or alert system.

### 3. Manufacturing ML Project

**Project Idea:**  
Build a predictive maintenance model to forecast equipment failure.

**Objective:**  
Predict when equipment might fail based on sensor or operational data, thereby enabling proactive maintenance and minimizing downtime.

**Steps:**
- **Data Acquisition:**  
  Use a public dataset such as the NASA Turbofan Engine Degradation Simulation or simulate time series sensor data.
- **Preprocessing:**  
  Clean the time series data, handle missing values, and engineer features like rolling averages or rate of change.
- **Modeling:**  
  Develop a forecasting or classification model to predict failure events (using techniques like LSTM networks for time series or gradient boosting for simpler setups).
- **Evaluation:**  
  Evaluate model performance using metrics appropriate for time series analysis or classification (e.g., accuracy, F1 score, or mean time to failure).
- **Deployment:**  
  Create an end-to-end pipeline that serves the model via an API and set up a dashboard for real-time predictions.
- **MLOps Touch:**  
  Integrate versioning (with tools like MLflow) and containerize the solution using Docker for consistent deployment.

### 4. Transportation & Logistics ML Project

**Project Idea:**  
Develop a demand forecasting model for a logistics network.

**Objective:**  
Predict shipment demand or delivery volume using historical data to optimize route planning and resource allocation.

**Steps:**
- **Data Acquisition:**  
  Use public datasets (e.g., historical shipment volumes) or simulate data reflecting typical logistics patterns.
- **Preprocessing:**  
  Clean and aggregate data by time (daily/weekly), and engineer features to capture seasonality, trends, and external factors (such as weather or holidays).
- **Modeling:**  
  Implement forecasting models such as ARIMA, Prophet, or deep learning approaches (e.g., RNN/LSTM).
- **Evaluation:**  
  Assess performance using forecasting metrics like MAPE (Mean Absolute Percentage Error) or RMSE.
- **Deployment:**  
  Deploy the model as a microservice using Flask or FastAPI, and optionally integrate it with a dashboard for visualization (using tools like Plotly Dash or Streamlit).
- **MLOps Touch:**  
  Set up automated retraining (e.g., via cron jobs) and log forecast errors for continuous model improvement.
